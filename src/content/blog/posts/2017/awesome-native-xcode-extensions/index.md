## Xcode extensions

You can find the actual list hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/theswiftdev/awesome-xcode-extensions) (~3k ⭐️).

The main reason for this is that the project is almost entirely driven by the community and this fact is truely amazing! In under just one year, the repository had a thousand stars on GitHub and it's counting! The list of awesome native Xcode extensions is open for everyone, so if you have an extension, please don't hesitate & create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)!

I'd like to say thank you for all the contributors, especially for [takasek](https://github.com/takasek) who categorized the list.

> Are you using Xcode extensions at all?

Personally I'm using 1-2 extensions, but nothing more. Maybe everything should be collected under one gigantic extension application with the ability of turning individual features on or off?

Does anybody have time for that? 🤔

You might feel the urge to implement your own extension. Not a problem. Here are some really amazing resources, to teach you how to make an Xcode plugin.

Fist of all let me emphasize that, this is the real world representation of what we're going to build in this little Swift adapter pattern tutorial:

![Picture of a USB Adapter](./assets/usb-adapter.jpg)

[Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. In other words, it transforms the interface of an object to adapt it to a different object.

So adapter can transform one thing into another, sometimes it's called wrapper, because it wraps the object and provides a new interface around it. It's like a software dongle for specific interfaces or legacy classes. (Dongle haters: it's time to leave the past behind!) üòÇ

## Adapter design pattern implementation

Creating an [adapter in Swift](https://medium.com/swiftworld/swift-world-design-patterns-adapter-3e09fc6fd100) is actually a super easy task to do. You just need to make a new object, "box" the old one into it and implement the required interface on your new class or struct. In other words, a wrapper object will be our adapter to implement the target interface by wrapping an other adaptee object. So again:

### Adaptee

The object we are adapting to a specific target (e.g. old-school USB-A port).

### Adapter

An object that wraps the original one and produces the new requirements specified by some target interface (this does the actual work, aka. the little dongle above).

### Target

It is the object we want to use adaptee with (our USB-C socket).

## How to use the adapter pattern in Swift?

You can use an adapter if you want to integrate a third-party library in your code, but it's interface doesn't match with your requirements. For example you can create a wrapper around an entire SDK or backend API endpoints in order to create a common denominator. üëΩ

In my example, I'm going to wrap an EKEvent object with an adapter class to implement a brand new protocol. üìÜ

```swift
import Foundation
import EventKit

// our target protocol
protocol Event {
    var title: String { get }
    var startDate: String { get }
    var endDate: String { get }
}

// adapter (wrapper class)
class EventAdapter {

    private lazy var dateFormatter: DateFormatter = {
        let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
        dateFormatter.dateFormat = "yyyy. MM. dd. HH:mm"
        return dateFormatter
    }()

    private var event: EKEvent

    init(event: EKEvent) {
        self.event = event
    }
}

// actual adapter implementation
extension EventAdapter: Event {

    var title: String {
        return self.event.title
    }
    var startDate: String {
        return self.dateFormatter.string(from: event.startDate)
    }
    var endDate: String {
        return self.dateFormatter.string(from: event.endDate)
    }
}

// let's create an EKEvent adaptee instance
let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
dateFormatter.dateFormat = "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm"

let calendarEvent = EKEvent(eventStore: EKEventStore())
calendarEvent.title = "Adapter tutorial deadline"
calendarEvent.startDate = dateFormatter.date(from: "07/30/2018 10:00")
calendarEvent.endDate = dateFormatter.date(from: "07/30/2018 11:00")

// now we can use the adapter class as an Event protocol, instead of an EKEvent
let adapter = EventAdapter(event: calendarEvent)
// adapter.title
// adapter.startDate
// adapter.endDate
```

Another use case is when you have to use several existing final classes or structs but they lack some functionality and you want to build a new target interface on top of them. Sometimes it's a good choice to implement an wrapper to handle this messy situation. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That's all about the adapter [design pattern](https://rubygarage.org/blog/swift-design-patterns). Usually it's really easy to implement it in Swift - or in any other programming language - but it's super useful and sometimes unavoidable. 

Kids, remember: don't go too hard on dongles! üòâ #himym

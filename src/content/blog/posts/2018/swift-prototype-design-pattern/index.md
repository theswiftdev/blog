[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern) is also a creational design pattern, it is useful when you have a very basic configuration for an object and you'd like to give (clone) those predefined values to another one. Basically you're making clones from a [prototype](https://medium.com/jeremy-codes/prototype-pattern-in-swift-1b50517d1075) objects. 😊😊😊

This approach has some benefits, one is for example that you don't have to subclass, but you can configure clones individually. This also means that you can remove a bunch of boilerplate (configuration) code if you are going to use prototypes. 🤔

```swift
class Paragraph {

    var font: UIFont
    var color: UIColor
    var text: String

    init(font: UIFont = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 12),
         color: UIColor = .darkText,
         text: String = "") {

        self.font = font
        self.color = color
        self.text = text
    }

    func clone() -> Paragraph {
        return Paragraph(font: self.font, color: self.color, text: self.text)
    }
}

let base = Paragraph()

let title = base.clone()
title.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 18)
title.text = "This is the title"

let first = base.clone()
first.text = "This is the first paragraph"

let second = base.clone()
second.text = "This is the second paragraph"
```

As you can see the implementation is just a few lines of code. You only need a default initializer and a clone method. Everything will be pre-configured for the prototype object in the init method and you can make your clones using the clone method, but that's pretty obvious at this point... 🤐

Let's take a look at one more example:

```swift
class Paragraph {

    var font: UIFont
    var color: UIColor
    var text: String

    init(font: UIFont = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 12),
         color: UIColor = .darkText,
         text: String = "") {

        self.font = font
        self.color = color
        self.text = text
    }

    func clone() -> Paragraph {
        return Paragraph(font: self.font, color: self.color, text: self.text)
    }
}

let base = Paragraph()

let title = base.clone()
title.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 18)
title.text = "This is the title"

let first = base.clone()
first.text = "This is the first paragraph"

let second = base.clone()
second.text = "This is the second paragraph"
```

The prototype design pattern is also [helpful](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13887704/whats-the-point-of-the-prototype-design-pattern) if you are planning to have snapshots of a given state. For example in a drawing app, you could have a shape class as a proto, you can start adding paths to it, and at some point at time you could create a snapshot from it. You can continue to work on the new object, but this will give you the ability to return to a saved state at any point of time in the future. 🎉

That's it about the prototype design pattern in Swift, in a nuthsell. 🐿

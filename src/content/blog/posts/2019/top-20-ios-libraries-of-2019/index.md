Sometimes it's just better to use a 3rd-party framework instead of reinventing the wheel, but there are some important questions that you should ask first:

- do I really need a library?
- what should I use?
- is it going to be supported?
- what if it's buggy? üêõ

Adding a dependency to your project can also lead to a [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt). Don't be lazy, learn the underlying technology first (or at least read about it or ask someone who actually knows about it) and if you're sure that the framework is a good choice, then give it a chance. In this list I've tried to collect future proof, trusted and well-known iOS libraries used by most of the developer community. ‚≠êÔ∏è

## Selection criteria:

- the framework has to be written in Swift
- the library should not be design specific (there is [cocoacontrols](https://www.cocoacontrols.com/) for that)
- it should be a runtime framework not a toolkit (aka. import XY)
- should have some package manager support (Carthage, CocoaPods, SPM)
- it has to support the latest major version of Swift
- must have at least 1000 stars on GitHub
